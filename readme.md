# Playtest Printer

Live at [playtest.hamatti.org](https://playtest.hamatti.org)

A one-page web app to print playtest cards for quick prototyping.

The card images are added by drag'n'dropping images to the page and when printed, it'll fit 9 cards on A4 page so that when they are cut, they fit inside a standard card sleeve (for 2.5"x3.5" cards) for playtesting.
